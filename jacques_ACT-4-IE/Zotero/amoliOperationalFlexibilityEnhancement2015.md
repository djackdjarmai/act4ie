Apart from conventional generation, One promising option greatly driven by the smart grid enabling technologies like smart meters is demand side manageme [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5242748/items/6YEBCFN9?page=3&annotation=3LTIMXM9)

> context of smart grid [2]. Energy storage systems (ESS), curtailment of variable RES output, electric vehicles, sub-hourly generation scheduling and transmission interconnection with neighboring networks are other alternative options available for increasing power system flexibility. One option or a combination of them could be used for providing increased flexibility in various electric power systems depending on their flexibility requirements [4]. Among options available, ESS has received great attention in the recent years such that many research efforts have been made in the literature to address its rol [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5242748/items/6YEBCFN9?page=3&annotation=X2JWP7Z4)

The role of energy storage for reducing wind power curtailment and providing flexibility to accommodate high shares of renewable generations in the ERCOT grid was explored in [10]. Also, the comparison of energy storage with other options for integrating variable generation and its potential role for increasing grid flex [(p. 3)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5242748/items/6YEBCFN9?page=3&annotation=LNY6T652)
