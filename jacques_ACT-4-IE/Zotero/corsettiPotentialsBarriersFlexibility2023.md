> Flexibility is increasingly a precious resource for system operators to recover electricity network issues due to uncertainties of renewable generation. Multi-energy systems are a reliable source of flexibility, and a mean to easily transfer flexibility from coupled energy carriers.

> In this paper a few aspects of the Italian regulation and market rules are assessed to quantify the benefits arising from the MESs flexibility considering a real district heating system in the Milan area. The assessment of flexibility is carried out in a bottom-up way by considering first each single device and then the whole plant. The goal of this journey consists in demonstrating the great potentials of MESs in provisioning flexibility to the power system.

> V. CONCLUSIONS The paper proposed an assessment of the regulatory and market frameworks to exploit flexibility from multi energy systems. This assessment was carried out by an optimization algorithm to maximize MES flexibility. The results show the relevant amount of flexibility cut by the current regulation and market frameworks. Though, this flexibility can be largely released relaxing the constraint concerning symmetry and dropping some of the cost components for downward services. Among the outcomes related to alternative scenarios it is not easy to choose those that represent the best ones. At this stage, these results mean to quantitatively support the discussion about regulation/market revision. [(p. 6)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5242748/items/AV7IAH8M?page=6&annotation=24CZYZ4R)
