> PEM electrolysers have considerably greater flexibility than the other technologies. This is particularly notable in relation to cold start-up and shut-down times, which range from 1 second to 5 minutes, compared to 1–10 minutes for Alkaline and < 60 minutes for SOEC. PEM electrolysers can also increase / decrease their electricity consumption at a rate of 100 % per second. That is, they can go from standby mode to nominal capacity in one second. This compares to 0.2 – 20 % per second for Alkaline electrolysers. Finally, PEM electrolysers have the broadest operating range, ranging from 0–160% of their nominal capacity. This compares to 10 –110 % for Alkaline and 20 –125 % for SOEC.7 [(p. 11)](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5242748/items/6FWFTS4H?page=11&annotation=QI6L2X9J)

> Alkaline electrolysers: Alkaline electrolysers appear to be able to provide system balancing services and congestion management. We have identified examples of this already taking place (e. g. Thyssenkrupp using Alkaline16). Certain limitations may exist for FCR regarding cold start-up and symmetry, and for aFRR in relation to cold start-up time. — Alkaline electrolysers are suitable for providing FCR only if they are in stand-by mode17 or already running. This is because their cold-start up time (1 to 10 minutes) is much longer than the full activation time (30 seconds). Similarly, there may be some limitations regarding Alkaline electrolysers to provide aFRR when the electrolysers are shut down. — Alkaline electrolysers can provide downward balancing by increasing their electricity consumption – if they are not running on maximum load. However, they are able to provide upward balancing (by decreasing their consumption) only when running. Therefore, the symmetry requirement is satisfied only if the status quo of the electrolyser for the bidding period is running or if the electrolyser is combined with another technology (e. g. battery) for which consumption can be decreased.

Windgas Haßfurt electrolyser using PEM18). Certain limitations may also exist for FCR regarding cold start-up and symmetry: — The cold start-up time of PEM electrolysers ranges from 1 second to 5 minutes, whereas the full activation time required for FCR is 30 seconds. Therefore, there may be some limitations regarding PEM’s ability to provide FCR when the electrolysers are shut down, as they may require more than 30 seconds. — PEM electrolysers can provide downward balancing by increasing their electricity consumption – if they are not running on maximum load. However, they are able to provide upward balancing (by decreasing their consumption) only when running. Therefore, the symmetry requirement is satisfied only if the status quo of the electrolyser for the bidding period is running or if the electrolyser is combined with additional equipment (as described for ALK above).

> SOEC electrolysers: SOEC electrolysers do not currently have the ability to provide system balancing and congestion management services. Aside from other characteristics, the typical plant size is too small to provide any of the system services.19 Enough information on the future evolution of SOEC electrolyser characteristics is not available to clearly determine whether they will be able to provide such services within a 2030 timeframe.

> Feeding electricity into the power grid (H2 to Power). An electrolyser and H2 storage facility alone are not able to feed energy back into the power grid. Additional facilities such as a large-scale H2 gas turbine or fuel cell are required. However, it is our current understanding that pure H2 gas turbines are not yet commercially available and likely will not be available at a sufficiently large scale in 2030.
